<h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>&quot;Simon Napier-Bell told me that bands who don&#39;t fight tend to be
creatively moribund. He recalled an argument between the Yardbirds in the
recording studio, over whether the guitarist, Jeff Beck, should be allowed a
solo. Beck felt he wasn&#39;t being given enough room to express himself.
Eventually, the others grudgingly let him have a few bars on a song called
&#39;The Nazz Are Blue.&#39; <a

<p>Napier-Bell sat with the band and watched as Beck recorded his solo. When it
came to his bars, Beck simply struck one note and let it bleed into feedback,
all the while glowering with defiance at his bandmates. &#39;Everything he felt
was in that note.&#39; said Napier-Bell. &#39;It&#39;s the high point of the
album.&#39;&quot;&#xFEFF;</p>


<h1 id="Services">The services we offer</h1>

<h2 id="Dita-in-Git">Dita in Git</h2>

<p>Let our customers use S3, BitBucket, GitHub, or GitLab for their content
manager, then use Xref to analyze their content and publish it with our
parallel publishing pipe line on AWS.</p>

<p>Specialize in liberating (ex) SDL customers!</p>

<h2 id="Dita-IO">Dita IO</h2>

<p>Using Dita Extensions create Dita documents with forms in them to replace
PDF forms.</p>

<h2 id="Information-Model-Automation">Information Model Automation</h2>

<p>Automate the creation of the Information Model and drive automation with the
Information Model.</p>

<p>my $im = q(Information Model);</p>

<p>An $im is produced for each Ryffine customer. There is a lot of text common
to each $im. The Dita for an $im could perhaps be produced with some minimal
automation to substitute variables into text?</p>

<h2 id="Translation-services">Translation services</h2>

<p>Translate documents using AWS translate, see: <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html</a>
for languages available.</p>

<h2 id="Speech-Service">Speech Service</h2>

<p>Translate text to speech using AWS Polly: <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/polly/features/">https://aws.amazon.com/polly/features/</a>
so that we can produce documents that speak!</p>

<h2 id="Text-deduplication">Text deduplication</h2>

<p>Find duplicate text for customers. We have the software and the compute
power - we just need access to customer data which we will be able to get
conveniently if the data is held in Git*.</p>

<h1 id="Operational-Improvements">Operational Improvements</h1>

<h2 id="Clean-Operational-Environment">Clean Operational Environment</h2>

<p>We spend too much time shuffling data between ourselves and our
customers.</p>

<p>Example: moving files between Aci, Ryffine and BlueStream burnt far more
time than just sending us a complete dump of the data in the first place. On
the 4 occasions they sent us a zip full of files they managed to do things in a
slightly different way each time which we then had to debug (at scale) to
ameliorate the consequences.</p>

<p>Example: using ftp versus having the customer put all their files in Github,
or S3, or onto an AWS instance i.e. in the cloud where we can work on them and
the customer can see what we are doing.</p>

<h2 id="Clean-data">Clean data</h2>

<p>At 4.00am after a two hour run on one of the largest machines at AWS I
discovered that Kohler had added two ampersands to their latest spread sheet
resulting in a failure to reach the goal of 100% lint.</p>

<h2 id="Avoid-Fragmenting-Our-Efforts">Avoid Fragmenting Our Efforts</h2>

<p>More generally, stop clients from dictating unscalable solutions because
they have no experience of scale whereas we do. Scale always magnifies the
slightest inconsistencies and errors which are invisible at the small scale
normally encountered in a customer&#39;s daily life. These invisible problems
become highly visible and thus problematic to us when we are working on lots of
their files at once.</p>

<p>Conversely, it is much more profitable to work on big projects than small
ones!</p>

<p>Dividing one big potentially profitable project into 4 small projects
potentially produces 4 unprofitable projects because of all the task switching
with other projects going on simultaneously.</p>

<p>However, we should still do a PoC on the square root of the number of
documents involved if we are unfamiliar with the source xml.</p>

<p>Every-one should read: &quot;The Mythical Man Month&quot;!!!!!</p>

<h2 id="The-ideal-conversion">The ideal conversion</h2>

<p>(1) We clean up the customers data</p>

<p>(2) We do a proof of concept for the customer using 1 or 2 representative
documents from each author (and their style guide).</p>

<p>(3) While we do the PoC the customer practices taking snapshots of all their
content. When the PoC is done the customer sends us a snapshot of ALL their
content.</p>

<p>(4) We enhance the conversion program and show the customer the proposed
results applied to their test snapshot.</p>

<p>(5) When the customer <b>reasonably</b> happy with the results they take a
new production snapshot - preferably on Friday and send it to us.</p>

<p>(7) We run the conversion program and send the results back within a few
hours.</p>

<p>(8) The customer checks the results and if good accepts them into their
production system and starts using them on Monday.</p>

<p>(9) If the customer discovers more changes they would like to make they
should: (a) Send us a new snap shot and a description of the changes to be made
(b) We write/test/run the code to perform the requested change (c) If the
customer is using a Git based system we send them the changed files as new
branches and the authors merge the branches as they see fit. (d) If the
customer is not using a Git based system we send them differential patches to
apply as they see fit. This is identical to the process that Git uses when
merging two branches so there is nothing novel here. (e) Repeat as necessary
until done.</p>

<p>Ideally we would bill after each step and not advance to the next step until
we are confident with the customers willingness to pay for the work completed
so far.</p>

<p>This approach allows us to get the maximum benefit from the conversion
effort in the shortest amount of time. Alternative solutions divide the work up
too much and spend too much time redoing the conversion to accommodate trailing
minor changes much better done as described in (8).</p>

<p>A major benefit of organizing work in this manner is that the hard part (the
conversion) can be done in one sprint without swapping to other projects
because all the data is available.</p>

<p>The subsequent easier incremental work can be done in short self contained
sprints gain without swapping.</p>

<h2 id="The-ideal-ticket">The ideal ticket.</h2>

<p>(1) Tells me how to find nodes to which to apply step (2) (2) Provides a
worked example step by step demonstrating the proposed transformation (3)
Provides a before file to become part of the regression test suite (4) Provides
an after file to show me the expected results (5) Might provide a wild example
if relevant</p>

<p>A well rehearsed ticket can be programmed while listening to &quot;In my
time of dying&quot; et al.</p>

<h2 id="Reduce-Travel-increase-Internet">Reduce Travel increase Internet</h2>

<p>Is it possible that the existing travel budget, if suitably redirected,
could provide every-one with full fiber access both in the office and at
home?</p>

<p>It would be much more efficient and safer to travel by using photons rather
than people in person!</p>

<h2 id="Cross-train">Cross train</h2>

<p>We should spend time showing each other how we get things done so that the
best techniques get adopted more widely and improved there upon.</p>

<p>(Example: I am not very sure what the Information Model is used for)</p>

<h2 id="Write-more-stuff-down-in-Dita-so-we-do-not-forget-how-to-do-it">Write more stuff down in Dita so we do not forget how to do it</h2>

<p>That is the essence of what we are telling our customers so we should
probably do it too!</p>
